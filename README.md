## suma

A command-line utility for subgraph matching.

To use suma as a library, have a look at the [subgraph-matching](https://crates.io/crates/subgraph-matching) crate.

This is work in progress and unstable.

This project is inspired by https://github.com/RapidsAtHKUST/SubgraphMatching, which is written in C++.
The corresponding [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3318464.3380581) was published at SIGMOD 2020.
